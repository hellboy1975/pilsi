## About PiLSI

A squeeze is a passage or element of a cave that requires careful consideration or planning of body positioning and movement to pass through.1  

Utilising the Pilkington-Lewis Squeeze Index (PiLSI) cave constrictions can be rated similarly to the climbing grades used by rock climbers.

PiLSI ratings can be easily added to  cave maps to convey details on the shape, incline, moisture level, hazards and degree of difficulty in a concise manner.

Two pieces of information are mandatory: the difficulty rating (1-15) and the structure description (eg. C for corkscrew). There are multiple optional descriptors for added detail.

The PiLSI is easy to understand and implement in any cave setting and corresponding cave map, which can aid in route planning and training exercises.

The PiLSI is named after prominent South Australian cavers Graham Pilkington (photo below left2) and Ian Lewis (photo below right3).
